## Cone in a 3D view
Link: https://cone.shagan.ru/

#### The application provides the following functionality:

1. This is a single page application (SPA), both with front-end and back-end.
2. The user enters parameters (cone height, radius and number of segments on a circle)
via client.
3. The client transfers the data to the server.
4. The server computes triangulation of the cone (i.e. a set of triangles to be used for
display) and passes it back to the client.
5. The client displays computed triangulation in a 3D view using WebGL (e.g. with the
help of the three.js library).


For back-end used Node.js and Express.js <br>
For front-end used React.js and three.js
